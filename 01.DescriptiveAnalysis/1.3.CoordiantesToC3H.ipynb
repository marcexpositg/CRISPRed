        "Previously, target regions were converted to the C3H genome, only to discover that a target region is just a place in the genome which has a gRNA +-500bp. This is not useful because we are interested in the cut site. This was done in the `C:\\Users\\Usuario\\Documents\\02.TransSynBio\\BioinfoThings\\coordinates\\ConversionC3H` folder.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, we got the coordinates of the gRNA (the exact bp locations) in the mm10 genome. Work done on the `C:\\Users\\Usuario\\Documents\\02.TransSynBio\\BioinfoThings\\coordinates\\ConversionC3Hv2` folder. These were used to get the following files with useful information:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `C3H_targets.csv`: gRNA_IDs,+-60bp sequence of the gRNA cutsite. Used to simulate data.\n",
        "- `C3H_gRNA-coordinates.bed`: Coordinates of the gRNAs in the C3H genome, only 1735 of 1785 gRNAs. this is the one that should be used to get the coverage.\n",
        "- `mm10_gRNA-coordinates.bed`: File with the original coordinates, but considering the indexing system (the ones used previously are the mm10_gRNA-coordinates_orig.bed)\n",
        "- `C3Hv2coordsMatch.tsv` contains relation of the gRNAs ID, sequence (not in Rev comp, so Rev gRNAs are not there), and old and new coordinates. Is like a summary of the conversion for only the selected subset of 1735 gRNAs.\n",
        "- `C3H_cutsite120nt_Seq_id_flt.bed`: could be useful because it cointains the same info from `C3H_targets.csv` but includes the coordinates in the C3H genome of each cut site. So it could be used to get coverage or so.\n",
        "\n",
        "Summary of the process:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Converted gRNA coordinates (mm10_gRNA-coordinates_orig.bed) into a minus one nt bed file to find the correct location (mm10_gRNA-coordinates.bed) in the genome (error with 0 and 1 indexing).\n",
        "2. Used Remap to map this file from mm10 genome to C3H genome. Got a couple of files: remapped_mm10_gRNA-coordinates.bed (not used),report_mm10_gRNA-coordinates.bed.xls (used).\n",
        "3. Converted Remap output to tab separated file to work with it: report_mm10_gRNA-coordinates.tsv\n",
        "4. Delete gRNAs that were duplicated. 3 gRNAs we are not sure if we know the exact location, but we keep them. Created `C3Hv2_preproccess_v2.tsv`.\n",
        "5. 30 gRNAs were not found by Remap. Deleted them. `C3Hv2_preproccess_v2.tsv` -> `C3Hv2_preproccess_v3.tsv`. From 1785 to 1755 gRNAs.\n",
        "6. Delete 20 gRNAs with differences in coverage (that could be corrected, but we didn't because manually it would take long) in `C3H_preproccess_v4.tsv`. Go from 1755 to 1735 (one coordinate is for two gRNAs totally revcomp).\n",
        "7. Convert to bed format (`C3Hv2coord_sub.bed`), and use `bedtools getfasta` to obtain the sequences, `C3Hv2coord_sub_Seq.bed`.\n",
        "8. In order to match coordinates with gRNA Id, the file C3Hv2MatchtoGrna.bed is created, which is a condensed version of the  C3Hv2_preprocess_v4.tsv (which has all the info between old and new coordinates).\n",
        "9. Then, we add the name (C3Hv2coordsMatch_noSeq.tsv) and sequnce of each gRNA, to create C3Hv2coordsMatch.tsv, that has all the coordinates information and the sequences and IDs.\n",
        "10. From this file with all the information we get the `bed` coordinates of the matched gRNAs in the C3H genome, in the `C3H_gRNA-coordinates.bed` file, that recalls the `mm10_gRNA-coordinates.bed` original coordinates format. Keep in mind the indexing of 0 and 1 for different apps.\n",
        "11. The names of the missing gRNAs are identified and kept in the `missinggRNAs.txt` file. We do that looking for the gRNAs in the original library, stored in tab sep format in the gRNAorigSeq.tsv file.  Since the sequence in the C3Hv2coordsMatch.tsv file is only in one direction and we need to do joins, we also create `gRNAorigSeqrev` that contains the revcomp sequence. \n",
        "12. We also try to get the gRNAs with point mutations, I am not sure if they are 74 or 24 (because i don't know if the 74 include the 50 gRNAs not matched on C3H). We keep them on `missinggRNAs.txt`. For that, we create the `notInFwd.txt` `norInReverse.txt` files that have intermidiate steps.\n",
        "13. Finally, to get the cut sites in an appropiate format, we create `discrepancy.awk` and see that the strand info of some gRNAs is not correct in the mm10, but luckly it is correct in the C3H genome, se we use that coordinates. To transform the coordinates we use the file with all the information `C3Hv2coordsMatch.tsv` and a awk script to make the coordinates cut site center in the 120nt, and take into account if sequence is fwd or reverse, this file is `C3H_cutsite120nt.bed`.\n",
        "14. From this file, we use `get-sequenceFromCord_strand.sh` to obtain the sequences of the target sites, in `C3H_cutsite120nt_Seq.bed`. We need to **remove 13 gRNAs** because their 120nt sequence contains `N` which would probably yield an error. So at the end, we obtain 1722 in the `C3H_cutsite120nt_Seq_flt.bed` file.\n",
        "15. Match each sequence with its ID. From the `C3H_cutsite120nt_Seq_flt.bed` file we match them using initial coordinates and get `C3H_cutsite120nt_Seq_id.bed`. There were 2 gRNAs that had same starting point (one of them is RevComp), so after deleting the duplication caused by this ones we end up with `C3H_cutsite120nt_Seq_id_flt.bed`\n",
        "16. This file is converted to the `csv` format required by the script of mutations, `C3H_targets.csv`.\n",
        "17. Conclusion, we look at 1722 targets. The difference from the full library of 1785 comes from 30 not matched + 20 coverage != 1 + 13 contain N in the C3H genome in regions adjacent to the cutsite. Some of the 1722 contain point mutations when compared to the mm10 genome."

Since target regions have higher coverage, there is a higher chance this is the correct place. Hence, we select this region for the gRNA that has it, which is `chrX_8805506`. The coordinates in `chrX_8805440` must be a bit lower than the coordinates of `chrX_8805506`, exactly 66nt lower. We find this region `3521450 3521472` which is exactly 66nt below the position found for `chrX_8805506`, so it might be correct! Finally, for `chrX_8805392`, it is 48 positions below `chrX_8805440`.

Previously we had studied that region and saw that even 1kb next to each possible position is repetitive. Since the 3 gRNAs are very close, we select only one of that regions. We made the selection nearly arbitrarily. Looking for the coverage we identified one region with higher coverage (~80x) than the rest (~60x), so we selected the 80x coverage area as the target of our guides. Then, we selected coordinates so that each of this three gRNAs are spaced evenly and in the same location.\n",
